# GRIN_Axicon
CODE V macro to model a GRIN-axicon and python scripts to fit the GRIN-axicon parameters to an existing axicon's parameters

# **Macro setup**
**Intallation process:**
1. Install the GRIN-axicon_macro.seq file
2. Copy the sequence file into the working directory
3. For ease of use, when first opening CODE V and, using the Macro Manager, assign the macro to a desired menu
4. Install the modified version of usergrn.seq
5. In the local repository where the built-in CODE V macro are saved, delete the original usergrn.seq and replace it by the modified one (in my case, C:\CODEV112_SR1\macro).

**Creating a GRIN**
1. Open CODE V
2. Run the GRIN-axicon_macro.seq either by a menu shortcut, the Macro Manager or by typing '''in GRIN-axicon_macro'''
3. Type the desired grin glass name
2. Select the desired mode (theo vs exp:  when using the experimental mode, make sure that the file is in the working directory)
4. Run macro with the desired parameters
