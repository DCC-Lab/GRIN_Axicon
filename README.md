# GRIN_Axicon
CODE V macro to model a GRIN-axicon and python scripts to fit the GRIN-axicon parameters to an existing axicon's parameters

# **Macro setup**
**Intallation process:**
1. Install the GRINmacro.seq file
2. Copy the sequence file into the working directory
3. For ease of use, when first opening CODE V, using the Macro Manager, assign the macro to a desired menu
4. Install the modified version of usergrn.seq
5. In the local repository where the built-in CODE V macro are saved, delete the original usergrn.seq and replace it by the modified one (in my case, C:\CODEV112_SR1\macro).
